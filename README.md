# FFMobile
This repository for a mobile website is for fantasy football players who wish to augment their knowledge of the sport with decision-making tools based off of statistical calculations on NFL teams and players within their custom fantasy football leagues.

A Yahoo! or ESPN fantasy football account is needed to make the most use of this website. One page you can access without needing a login is ~/Yahoo/WeeklyRankingsPPR if you would like to sample the code.
